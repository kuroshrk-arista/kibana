The logo.png file provides the kibana logo on the top left corner.

The welcome.png file provides the circular icon in the middle of
the login screen. It's also used when screen is busy waiting.
The files are referenced from public/less/main.less.

The favicon.ico is a small icon on the window tab of the browser.
It overrides the default kibana favicon.ico.

For Dell OEM builds, the files are copied over from bsn-dell-*
files. These png files contains combined BSN and Dell-EMC logo
edited by hand.

It would be better to display the Dell-EMC logo at the separate
location on the screen. This requires a bit more work. The
combined images are good enough for now.
